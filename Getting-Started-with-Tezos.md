First you will need Tezos and a Tezos wallet.

## What is Tezos?
Tezos (XTZ) is a liquid proof-of-stake cryptocurrency (LPoS). You can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tezos)

## What wallets do you recommend?
Most of our users use [Kukai wallet](https://wallet.kukai.app/) or [Temple wallet](https://templewallet.com/). We've seen issues with Airgap so we don't recommend it.

## Where to buy tezos
Minting on hicetnunc only costs ~0.08 tezos. You can buy some on an exchange site like Binance or Kraken, however we recommend consulting with someone who is from whatever country you are in because exchange services are provided depending on the country.

## The Hicetnunc Tezos Fountain
⛲
Need tezos but can't get them? You can request someone to sponsor you in the #tezos-fountain channel on Discord.

Please send a message with:
* a little bit about you and why you are looking for a sponsorship
* your wallet address with zero tezos in it
* a link to a post on your social media account with the fountain emoji. Your social media account has to have your art on it, has to have followers, and has to have been made more than a month ago. We ask for this to make sure you are a legit artist and not a scammer. (Lying about your identity will result in an immediate ban from the Discord).

This channel is open to the community and if someone is willing to sponsor you they will send you some tezos.
