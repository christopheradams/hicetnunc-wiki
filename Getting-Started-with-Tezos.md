First you will need Tezos and a Tezos wallet.

## What is Tezos?
Tezos (XTZ) is a liquid proof-of-stake cryptocurrency (LPoS). You can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tezos)

## What wallets do you recommend?
We recommend [Kukai wallet](https://wallet.kukai.app/). We've seen issues with Airgap and lately with Temple so we don't recommend it.

## Where to buy tezos
Minting on hicetnunc only costs ~0.08 tezos. You can buy some on an exchange site like Binance or Kraken, however we recommend consulting with someone who is from whatever country you are in because exchange services are provided depending on the country.

â›²### Applying as an Artist
Are you an artist who needs tezos but can't get them? You can request a volunteer from the community to sponsor you in the #tezos-fountain channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/FwZyeQp5).

Please send a message with:

* your wallet address with zero tezos in it
* a link to a post on your social media account with the fountain emoji. Your social media account has to have your art on it, has to have followers, and has to have been made more than a month ago. We ask for this to make sure you are a legit artist and not a scammer. (Lying about your identity will result in an immediate ban from the Discord).

â›²### Volunteering as a Sponsor
This channel is open to the community and if someone is willing to sponsor you can send an artist some tezos.

If you volunteer to sponsor someone, please put a 100% emoji on their post so we know they have been sponsored. We recommend sending 0.33333 tez.

![account doesnt exist error from tzkt.io](https://imgshare.io/images/2021/05/15/account_doesnt_exist.png)
Pro tip: If your account on tzkt.io shows this, don't worry. It just means you don't have any transactions yet in your wallet. Once you receive some tezos it should go away.

Already have tezos?
