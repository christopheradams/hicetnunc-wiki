First you will need Tezos and a Tezos wallet.

## What is Tezos?
Tezos (XTZ) is a liquid proof-of-stake cryptocurrency (LPoS). You can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tezos)

## What wallets do you recommend?
Most of our users use [Kukai wallet](https://wallet.kukai.app/) or [Temple wallet](https://templewallet.com/). We've seen issues with Airgap so we don't recommend it.

## Where to buy tezos
Minting on hicetnunc only costs ~0.08 tezos. You can buy some on an exchange site like Binance or Kraken, however we recommend consulting with someone who is from whatever country you are in because exchange services are provided depending on the country.

## The Hicetnunc Tezos â›² Fountain 
Need tezos but can't get them? You can request someone to sponsor you in the #tezos-fountain channel on Discord.

Please send a message with:
* your wallet address
* a link to a social media account that has your art on it, has followers, and was made more than a month ago
* a little bit about you and why you are looking for a sponsorship

This channel is open to the community and if someone is willing to sponsor you they will send you some tezos.
